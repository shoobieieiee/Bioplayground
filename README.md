NVIDIA BioNeMo Framework is a collection of programming tools, libraries, and models for computational drug discovery.
It accelerates the most time-consuming and costly stages of building and adapting biomolecular AI models by providing
domain-specific, optimized models and tooling that are easily integrated into GPU-based computational resources for the
fastest performance on the market. You can access BioNeMo Framework as a free community resource here in this repository
or learn more at <https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/bionemo/> about getting an enterprise license for improved
expert-level support.

The `bionemo-framework` is partitioned into independently installable namespace packages. These are located under the
`sub-packages/` directory. Please refer to [PEP 420 – Implicit Namespace Packages](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/)
for details.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation,
including user guides, API references, and troubleshooting information, can be found in our official documentation at
<https://docs.nvidia.com/bionemo-framework/latest/>

For those interested in exploring the latest developments and features not yet included in the released container, we
also maintain an up-to-date documentation set that reflects the current state of the `main` branch. This in-progress
documentation can be accessed at <https://nvidia.github.io/bionemo-framework/>

Please note that while this documentation is generally accurate and helpful, it may contain references to features or
APIs not yet stabilized or released. As always, we appreciate feedback on our documentation and strive to continually
improve its quality.

## Using the BioNeMo Framework

Full documentation on using the BioNeMo Framework is provided in our documentation:
<https://docs.nvidia.com/bionemo-framework/latest/user-guide/>. To facilitate the process of linking against optimized
versions of third-party dependencies, BioNeMo is primarily distributed as a containerized library. The latest released
container for the BioNeMo Framework is available for download through
[NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/clara/containers/bionemo-framework). Launching a pre-built
container can be accomplished through the `brev.dev` link at the top of the page, or by running

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --gpus=all --ipc=host --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/clara/bionemo-framework:main--nightly \
  /bin/bash
```

### Setting up a local development environment

#### Initializing 3rd-party dependencies as git submodules

The NeMo and Megatron-LM dependencies are vendored in the bionemo-2 repository workspace as git submodules for
development purposes. The pinned commits for these submodules represent the "last-known-good" versions of these packages
that are confirmed to be working with bionemo2 (and those that are tested in CI).

To initialize these sub-modules when cloning the repo, add the `--recursive` flag to the git clone command:

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:NVIDIA/bionemo-framework.git
```

To download the pinned versions of these submodules within an existing git repository, run

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Different branches of the repo can have different pinned versions of these third-party submodules. Make sure you
update submodules after switching branches or pulling recent changes!

To configure git to automatically update submodules when switching branches, run

```bash
git config submodule.recurse true
```

**NOTE**: this setting will not download **new** or remove **old** submodules with the branch's changes.
You will have to run the full `git submodule update --init --recursive` command in these situations.

#### Building the bionemo-framework docker image

With a locally cloned bionemo-framework repository, an appropriately configured
[nvidia-container-toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
build toolchain, and initialized submodules, the bionemo container can be built with

```bash
docker buildx build . -t my-container-tag
```

#### Intellisense and interactive debugging with the VSCode Devcontainer

We distribute a [development container](https://devcontainers.github.io/) configuration for vscode
(`.vscode/devcontainer.json`) that simplifies the process of local testing and development. Opening the
bionemo-framework folder with VSCode should prompt you to re-open the folder inside the devcontainer environment.

> [!NOTE]
> The first time you launch the devcontainer, it may take a long time to build the image. Building the image locally
> (using the command shown above) will ensure that most of the layers are present in the local docker cache.

### Quick Start

See the [tutorials pages](https://docs.nvidia.com/bionemo-framework/latest/user-guide/examples/bionemo-esm2/pretrain/)
for example applications and getting started guides.
